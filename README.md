1. Using SELECT and FROM ststaments to retrieve columns from the desired tables
2. Filtering for column names as outputs
3. Using GROUPBY and ORDERBY to group records together by a common value and sort records by ASC (ascending) or DESC (descending).
4. Utilising the inner join and left join to connect two or more columns together using a primary and foreign key, displaying records with corresponding values in other tables.
